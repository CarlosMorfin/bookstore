# This file should require seeds/* files for record creation needed to seed the
# database with its default values. The data can then be loaded with the rails
# db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   load File.expand_path('../seeds/users.rb', __FILE__)
#
load File.expand_path('../seeds/roles.rb', __FILE__)
